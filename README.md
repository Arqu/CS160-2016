# CS160-2016

This repository is aimed at CS160 lab students at SSST for 2016.

## Baby Steps

A pre-requisite for this class is that you get familiar with your console/terminal/command line.
Before doing anything please read up on [git](https://git-scm.com/) and install the git client.
If you are unfamiliar with git you have several guides to get you started [here](https://guides.github.com/).

## Getting Started

To get started please send me your github usernames to asmir.avdicevic@stu.ssst.edu.ba to add you to the repository.
The next step is to clone this repository.

Once set up create a branch named `2016/FirstName-LastName`
```sh
cd /path/to/your/repository
git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
```

## Task

You can find all your tasks on `2016/tasks` - read the [task guide](https://github.com/Arqu/CS160-2016/tree/2016/tasks).

## Expectations

You are to submit your commit by the end of the lab session to your branch containing all your work under a folder named `MM-DD` where `MM` represents the month and `DD` represents the day.

## Submitting Your Work

Every task should be named `task-ID.cpp` where `ID` stands for the number of the task on that day. Please adhere to this naming convention as work will be automatically graded and will use these naming conventions to do so. Failure to adhere to this will result in 0 points graded for the given task.
