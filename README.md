# CS160-2016

This repository is aimed at CS160 lab students at SSST for 2016.

# Tasks

Every task has its statement. Unless noted otherwise you can assume we are using stdin and stdout.
Please respect output formats as most task will be reviwed semi automatically. The expected output format is given in case formating is expected.
`[value]` represents the value you need to provide for the output.

# Plagiarism 

Plagiarism is not accepted and will be reviewed. In case plagiarism is detected commits with older timestamps will have priority - all other will be discarded.
In the odd case of the same timestamps we will discard all since it is probably due to tampering with them.

You will have the chance to defend your code.
